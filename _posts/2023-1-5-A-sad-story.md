Some time has passed since I decide to write about my experience in the program **Skills for Women in Tech** and I have to say that was very dissapointing at least from my side towards the program, because I had to desert for many reasons, especially the College. 

What I mean can be reduced in that I didn't finish the program but I want to talk about what I learned and the last experience that I had, just because I don't want to leave it empty in this blog. 

Well, when I desert my team support me and they told me that perhaps it was not going to be necessary provided that I always be in contact and inform them about my problems. But the big problem was that I had no time to be in contact neither even to inform them when I had a difficulty, so in one part of the project in which I was assigned a task I took longer than expected and the worst thing is that I couldn't finish it even that way. Although I would like to blame the school, the truth is that it was partly my decision and negligence. After that basically everything went from bad to worse until I got to the point of giving up completely. I don't know if it was because I didn't feel like going on, or I went into one of those sad lapses where I don't think it makes much sense anymore. 

I recognize that there was a lot of insistence for me to stay, from the team and the mentors. The rest is a blur but I think I was really discouraged that I was not contributing anything useful even after so many mentorships and classes. I can't complain about what happened in there because everything bad was my fault. And at best I can dwell on the idea that it was something too big to comprehend intensively. Hackademy is an excellent institution, which although small has a lot to offer. Maybe later I can try.
