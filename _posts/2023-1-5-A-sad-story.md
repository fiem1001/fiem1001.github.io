It's been some time since I decided to write about my experience in the program **Skills for Women in Tech** and I have to say that was very dissappointing for my towards the program, because I had to drop out for many reasons, primarily due to College commitments. 

In essence, I didn't complete the program, but I'd like to share what I learned and my final experience, as I don't want to leave this blog post empty. 

When I dropped out of the program, my team was supportive and suggested I stay in touch and keep them updated on any issues. However, I struggled to maintain contact and inform them about my problems, which ultimately led to a task taking longer than expected and not being completed. In hindsight, I realize that it was partly my decision and negligence that contributed to my struggles. As things continued to deteriorate, I eventually reached a point where I felt like giving up completely. 

I acknowledge that the team and mentors were eager for me to stay, but I was disheartened by my perceived lack of contribution, despite numerous mentorships and classes. In hindsight, I take full responsibility for my struggles, and I can only speculate that the program may have been too ambitious for me. Hackademy is a reputable institution that offers a lot, and I may consider re-engaging with them in the future.
